Now that we've warmed up it's time to get inside a container while it's running!

Image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu` will start a container that outputs logs into a file. Go inside the running container and use `tail -f ./text.log` to follow the logs. Every 10 seconds the clock will send you a "secret message".

Submit the secret message and command(s) given as your answer.
