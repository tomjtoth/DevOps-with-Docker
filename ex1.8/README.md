By default our `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine` doesn't have a CMD. Instead, it uses ENTRYPOINT to declare which application is run.

We'll talk more about ENTRYPOINT in the next section, but you already know that the last argument in `docker run` can be used to give a command or an argument.

As you might've noticed it doesn't start the web service even though the name is "simple-web-service". A suitable argument is needed to start the server!

Try `docker run devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine hello`. The application reads the argument "hello" but will inform that hello isn't accepted.

In this exercise create a Dockerfile and use FROM and CMD to create a brand new image that automatically runs `server`.

The Docker documentation CMD says a bit indirectly that if a image has ENTRYPOINT defined, CMD is used to define it the default arguments.

Tag the new image as "web-server"

Return the Dockerfile and the command you used to run the container.


```sh
$ docker build . -t web-server
