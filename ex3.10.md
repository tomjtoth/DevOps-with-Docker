I reworked my previous tsoha project and after separating postgres (yes I used 1 postgres container and glued my project on top of it x'D at the end of Part 1 of this course) from my image I got 235MB. Changes (including adjustments to the project itself) can be seen [here](https://github.com/tomjtoth/veripalvelu/compare/1f3e52797505cbb07f7e3899d253ddad5484cb62...96645d189a9905a8f972493907514ef82951f7a1). 

I ended up using the same `.env` file for both the flask app and docker compose itself, which gets generated by `setup.sh` after cloning the project.

```sh
$ docker image ls
